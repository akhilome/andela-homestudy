# Important Notice

Since creating this repo back in April (2018), Andela has revamped and improved their homestudy curriculum, adding more resources which they believe will help one level up enough to become fit for the fellowship's bootcamp. Please endevour to make use of the [updated Homestudy Curriculum](http://github.andela.com/homestudy/)..

_Deprecated curriculum continued below ..._

# Andela (Nigeria) Cycle 32 Home Study Curriculum (Javascript).

This md contains the Javascript-centric version of the Andela Nigeria Homestudy Curriculum for cohort recruitment cycle 32.

I created this repo for two main reasons:

- To always have access to the homestudy resources -- this is due to the fact that Andela's curriculum [homepage online](http://github.andela.com/homestudy/) is not always accessible (_especially when I need it the most_), and I tried saving for offline use, but to no avail.

- To track my progress as I work my way down the curriculum -- ticking each checkbox as I complete each element in each module.

As previously stated, this is the Javascript-focussed version of the curriculum. To see the full curriculum (python inclusive version), visit the [Andela Online Homestudy Curriculum Page](http://github.andela.com/homestudy/) -- that is, of course, if it is accessible.

## Intro to Computer Science

In this module, we will introduce basic computer science concepts. We will cover all the areas required to get you to the point of understanding what a computer scientist does.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a logical concept that introduces a way to organize data so the data can be immediately available to the processor for required calculations. This module will cover ways in which data is stored for efficient search and retrieval.

## Algorithms

Computer scientists learn by experience. We learn by seeing other people solve problems and by solving problems ourselves. Exposing us to different problem-solving techniques and seeing how algorithms are designed helps us take on challenging problems.

## Recursion

Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. We have seen that functions are named procedures which perform distinct tasks or services. This module will address recursion as a technique involving the use of functions.
